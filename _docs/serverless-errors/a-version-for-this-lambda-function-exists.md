#### Error Message

> An error occurred: xxxxxxxxx - A version for this Lambda function exists ( 1 ). Modify the function to create a new version.


#### Problem

This error is caused by Serverless Framework trying to create a new version of your Lambda function when the code has not changed. It detects changes by generating a SHA checksum of the code.

Use of certain Serverless plugins or rare glitches in Serverless Framework could also cause this issue.


#### Solution

Most likely, this is an issue with your code. Changes that indirectly affect the code, like changing how environment variables are set (e.g. when moving to Seed secrets), can also cause this.

A one time workaround for this issue is to make a dummy change in a function's code and deploy again.

If the issue persists, you can try turning off Lambda versioning by setting the following in your `serverless.yml`.

``` yml
...

provider:
  name: aws
  versionFunctions: false

...
```
